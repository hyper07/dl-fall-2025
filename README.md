*Columbia University SPS × Advanced Medical Imaging - Deep Learning Project Fall 2025*

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements an intelligent wound detection and classification system using deep learning techniques. The platform provides healthcare professionals with automated wound analysis capabilities, supporting the identification of various wound types through computer vision and machine learning.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Class Wound Classification**: Identifies 10 different wound types including abrasions, bruises, burns, cuts, diabetic wounds, lacerations, pressure wounds, surgical wounds, venous wounds, and normal skin
- **Apple Silicon MPS Support**: Optimized for macOS with Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) acceleration for faster training on Apple Silicon Macs
- **Web-Based Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for image upload and analysis
- **Vector Search**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for efficient similarity search and image retrieval
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Automated training scripts with support for multiple CNN architectures
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized environment for easy deployment and scaling
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant wound classification and confidence scoring

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of multiple interconnected services:

## 🧠 Model Training

### Advanced Training Options

```bash
# Full enhanced training with MPS acceleration and progress bars
python train_model.py \
  --architecture efficientnet \
  --exact_rotations \
  --device mps \
  --progress_bar \
  --epochs 50 \
  --data_dir ./files/train_dataset

# Quiet training (suppress TensorFlow warnings)
python train_model.py \
  --quiet \
  --device auto

# Minimal training without progress bars
python train_model.py \
  --augment \
  --exact_rotations=false \
  --progress_bar=false \
  --device auto

# Fine-tuning after initial training
python train_model.py --fine_tune --fine_tune_epochs 10 --unfreeze_layers 30
```

### Data Augmentation

The training pipeline supports comprehensive data augmentation:

- **Standard Augmentation**: Random rotations (±40°), shifts, and flips
- **Enhanced Augmentation** (`--exact_rotations`): Exact 90°, 180°, 270° rotations + horizontal/vertical flips
- **Effective Dataset Size**: Up to 8x multiplication with exact transformations

**Augmentation Types:**
- Rotations: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°
- Flips: Horizontal, vertical, and combined transformations
- Random augmentations: Small rotations, shifts, and scaling

### Training Progress

The training script provides detailed progress monitoring:

- **TQDM Progress Bars**: Real-time progress bars for epochs and batches
- **Live Metrics**: Training loss, accuracy, and validation metrics displayed in progress bars
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging to console and training.log file
- **Model Checkpoints**: Automatic saving of best models during training

### Supported Architectures

- **ResNet50**: Default choice, good balance of accuracy and speed
- **VGG16**: Deeper architecture for complex feature extraction
- **EfficientNet**: Optimized for computational efficiency

### Configuration

Training parameters can be customized via `training_config.json`:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "batch_size": 32,
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "epochs": 20,
    "validation_split": 0.2
  }
}
```

- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed error analysis
- **ROC Curves**: Multi-class classification performance

## � Troubleshooting

### TensorFlow Mutex Lock Warnings

If you see messages like `[mutex.cc : 452] RAW: Lock blocking 0x...`, this is normal TensorFlow behavior on macOS with MPS. These warnings indicate TensorFlow is properly initializing GPU acceleration.

**To suppress these warnings:**
```bash
python train_model.py --quiet
```

**What these warnings mean:**
- TensorFlow is acquiring internal locks for thread-safe operations
- MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) initialization on macOS
- Safe to ignore - they don't affect training performance

### Common Issues

**MPS/GPU Acceleration Not Working:**
- Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.13+ installed
- On macOS, MPS is automatically enabled
- Use `--device cpu` to force CPU-only training

**Memory Issues:**
- Reduce batch size: `--batch_size 8`
- Use CPU training: `--device cpu`
- Close other GPU-intensive applications

**Import Errors:**
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For Docker: `docker-compose build --no-cache`

### Python Version

This project requires **Python 3.12+** for optimal compatibility with:
- TensorFlow 2.15+ (latest MPS support for macOS)
- TQDM progress bars
- Modern scikit-learn and data science libraries

**For local development:**
```bash
python --version  # Should show Python 3.12.x
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
